ServiceSPOTTER disclaims all representations and warranties, express, implied, or statutory, not expressly set out in these terms, including the implied warranties of merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose and non-infringement.

ServiceSPOTTER shall not be liable for indirect, incidental, special, exemplary, punitive, or consequential damages, including lost profits, lost data, personal injury, or property damage related to, in connection with, or otherwise resulting from any use of the services, regardless of the negligence (either active, affirmative, sole, or concurrent) of ServiceSPOTTER, even if ServiceSPOTTER has been advised of the possibility of such damages.

The limitations and disclaimer in this section do not purport to limit liability or alter your rights as a consumer that cannot be excluded under applicable law.

This provision shall have no effect on ServiceSPOTTER’s choice of law provision set forth below.
